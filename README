Description
ColdMVC is a convention based MVC framework for ColdFusion 9 loosely based on concepts from Ruby on Rails and Grails.

Licensing
I don't know much about open source licensing. With that being said, ColdMVC is free to use or modify, but don't blame me if you break it or it crashes your server. This is pre-alpha software. Use at your own risk.

Operating System
I've written everything using Windows 7, although things should work fine on a Mac. If they don't, let me know.

ColdFusion Server
ColdMVC was written specifically for Adobe ColdFusion 9. I don't believe it will work on any other platforms without full support for Hibernate ORM.

Dependencies
ColdMVC requires ColdSpring (http://www.coldspringframework.org/)

Installation
	1. Download ColdMVC
	2. Download ColdSpring
	3. Create server mappings in ColdFusion administrator for ColdMVC and ColdSpring or put them in your server's webroot
	4. Create a new ColdFusion project
	5. Create a new datasource in ColdFusion adminstrator with the same name as your project
	6. Start building your applications

For further guidance, check out the sample applications inside /coldmvc/samples/.

Documentation
I'll try to get more documentation available when I can, but admittedly it's not a very high priority for me right. If anyone would like to help out, I'd appreciate it.

Bugs
If you find a bug, you can either log it on GitHub (http://github.com/tonynelson19/ColdMVC/issues) or contact me directly via email or twitter.

Future Plans
There are still quite a few more features I'd like to add (logging, validation, security), but haven't decided on the best approach yet. I'm also open to feature requests, so feel free to contact me.
